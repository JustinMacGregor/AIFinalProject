# Abstract
Classification is a supervised learning technique that acts on a dataset with non-numerical features and labels, and learns a function that provides an outcome for a target value. In this project, classification techniques are used to predict the outcome of a chess game based on certain moves made by the black pieces or the white pieces. These moves are labelled in the columns of the dataset with certain acronyms for the different moves and scenarios. The model I have finalized for this classification problem is K-Nearest Neighbor (or KNN). With the final tuned KNN model, the classification problem received an accuracy performance of 91.77%. When making new predictions, the KNN model received scores between the low 60th and high 80th percentile.
